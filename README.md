# CO327-Operating-Systems---Vital-Monitor-System
Operating systems - mini project

## Aim: 
This project aims to get hands-on experience in a real-world scenario. You will
require the knowledge of networking, operating systems, and programming to complete
this project.
## Background: 
This project is based on a real-life scenario. In a hospital, there will be a
number of patients whose vitals (things like heart rate, blood pressure, etc.) should be
monitored. Each patient would be connected to a vital monitor and these monitors will
transmit the vital information over a network to a central location. That way nursing staff
will be able to monitor many patients and do it remotely â€“ which is useful when the
patients are contagious.
## Specifications: 
There will be a set of vital monitors running. Each of these vital
monitors will have an IP address. These vital monitors will be running on a server. Vital
monitors will broadcast their identity to a specific UDP port in the following format:
<ip_addr, port, monitor_id>.

### Your tasks are as follows.

1) Implement a gateway that discovers all of these vital monitors.
2) For each discovered monitor, the gateway should initiate a TCP connection with
the vital monitor. It should use the discovered port number and IP address for this
connection. This TCP connection will be used to receive vital information and
alarms from vital monitors.
3) Consider thread synchronization where appropriate and implement thread
synchronizations in your gateway implementation.
